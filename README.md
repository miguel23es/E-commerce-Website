# E-commerce Website

A personal full-stack e-commerce website for clothing that I built to practice real-world web development and payment processing. The site allows users to browse products, manage a shopping cart, and complete secure purchases using Stripe.

## About the Project

This project was built as a personal initiative to deepen my understanding of full-stack web development, backend logic, and third-party API integrations. I focused on creating a smooth user experience on the frontend while implementing a functional and secure checkout flow on the backend.

The checkout system is powered by **Node.js** and integrated with the **Stripe API**, simulating a real online store payment experience.

## What I Built

Since this was a solo project, I was responsible for the entire development process, including:

- Designing and implementing the frontend UI  
- Building the Node.js backend to handle checkout requests  
- Integrating Stripe for secure payment processing  
- Testing and debugging the full purchase flow  
- Structuring the project so it resembles a real production application
